        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Whole spices</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 cups of water to a boil &add the 1 cup cubed onions (110 grams). Boil for 2 to 3 mins. Drain theblanched onions.</li>
        <li>Add blanched onions, 1½ to 1¾ cups tomatoes (340 grams), 1 to2 small cardamoms, 1 green chili (optional) and 12 to 14 cashew nuts toa grinder jar. If you want you can also add ¼ cup yogurt at this stageand then blend.</li>
        <li>Make a fine smooth puree. We don't want any chunks of cashews inthe puree. If you do not have a powerful blender, you may pass througha sieve and blend the coarse mixture again.</li>
        <li>Optional step. Saute paneer in little oil and immerse them in warmwater until used.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil or ghee in a pan. Add ½ teaspoon cuminseeds, 1 green cardamom, 2 cloves, 1 inch cinnamon & bay leaf. Whenthe spices sizzle, reduce the heat, add 1½ teaspoon ginger garlic paste.</li>
        <li>Fry ginger garlic paste until the raw smell goes off. Do this on a lowflame to avoid splatters.</li>
        <li>Add the ground onion tomato puree & saute on a medium heatstirring often. You can partially cover the pan if it splatters a lot.</li>
        <li>Saute until the masala cooks well and the raw smell disappearscompletely.</li>
        <li>Add ¾ to 1 teaspoon chili powder, ¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala,½ to ¾ teaspoon coriander powder, 1 teaspoon sugar and ½ to ¾ salt.Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup peas and pour 1.5 cups water. If you are using frozenpeas, you may add them later.</li>
        <li>Mix well and cook until the gravy thickens and the peas soft cook. Ifusing frozen tender peas, you can add them after the gravy cooks for awhile as the frozen ones cook faster.</li>
        <li>When the gravy turns thick, you will also see some oil on top of thegravy. There is not much oil used in the recipe so you can see very littleoil on top. To the thick gravy, add paneer and 1 tsp crushed kasurimethi. Crush the kasuri methi in between your palms and then add.</li>
        <li>Cook for just 1 to 2 minutes. If you fry the paneer at the earlier step,skip cooking again here. Using cream is optional. Pour 4 tbsps cream to a small bowl, add little gravy and mix well. Stir this into the pan.</li>
