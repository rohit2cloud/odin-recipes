    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../Images/lasagna.jpeg" width="200px" alt="">
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>meat sauce</li>
        <li>cottage cheese mixture</li>
        <li>mozarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesanâ€”like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>

    </ol>
